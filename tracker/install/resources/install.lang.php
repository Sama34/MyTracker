	<h3>Upgrading?</h3>
	<p>You should check the <a href="http://xekko.co.uk/mytracker/">MyTracker Homepage</a> for information on how to upgrade your tracker. By upgrading your version of MyTracker, you keep all of your current Projects, Issues, Features and Comments.</p>

<p>This option will <span style="color: red;">delete any existing tracker you may have set up</span> and install a fresh version of MyTracker. It will try and automatically create a backup of MyTracker data for you (located in the \'backups\' folder), but really, you should backup your entire forum.</p>
<p>Please note that this uninstaller will attempt to resync your forum stylesheets. This should help optimise your forum, but is still in experimental stages. Please remember to backup your entire forum and database before making any changes.</p>
