# MyTracker
Updated MyTracker to Mybb 1.8.x
MyTracker is a quick, simple and effective issue tracking system that fully integrates with your MyBB community. It allows your community to track "bugs" or issues in any project - from the latest software you're making to doing your homework.

You can manage your developers/workers, statuses, priorities and pretty much everything else too. MyTracker uses MyBB's template system, so you can customise it in whatever way you want - you can also change the language pack so you can translate it into your own language!

MyTracker also uses MyBB's ACP tabs as its main navigation. It features ajax-style pagination, comments, an activity timeline and an ideas system - much like what you see where on MyBB.


#Installation
To install MyTracker, just upload all the files in the download to your forum (keeping the structure in the folder), and browse to ./tracker/install/. Follow the simple instructions and you'll be tracking in no time. For more info, see the readme file in the download.
